This software package contains three subpackages useful to perform L1 track trigger simulation using the associative memory approach within the official CMSSW framework:

- Configuration: for generating particle gun samples
- NTupleTools: for flattening EDM ROOT files
- AMSimulation: for simulation of associative-memory-based track finding 

See [wiki](https://github.com/jiafulow/SLHCL1TrackTriggerSimulations/wiki) for more information.
